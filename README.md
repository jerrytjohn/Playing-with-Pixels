# Playing-with-Pixels
A repository for the unity projects I've worked on that help me make mathematically assisted art.

Roshan's Dice image art is pretty functional.God does not play Dice still needs to made into a thing.

Tania's string portrait code is 80% up to mark. I wish I had thought about creating this repository sooner. :-(

And the Rubik's filter with the weighted probability toss between two similar colours seems like a solid idea. Shouldn't take long to code up. You should get on that, right after you finish editing Tania's video.
